# TOV 
Tolman-Volkoff-Oppenheimer solver for neutron star structure

A simple python project that implements a TOV solver to solve relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium equations. Additionally, some general equations of states for the ultra-dense matter are given.

Main code is in `tov.py`

Additionally 
- `eoslib.py` gives polytropic indices for some general EoSs (from Read et al 2009)
- `crust.py` neutron star crust EoS 
- `polytropes.py` internal monotrope and polytrope class
- `units.py` some (cgs) units for computations
